# Stablecoin Pegging

## Project Title
Stablecoin Pegging - A smart contract for a stablecoin pegged to a basket of assets or fiat currency.

## Project Description
This project implements a Move smart contract on the Aptos blockchain that creates a stablecoin pegged to a basket of assets. The stablecoin maintains its value through a reserve system that holds collateral assets (initially Aptos Coin) with a configurable peg ratio that can be adjusted to represent multiple assets in a basket.

The contract provides core functionality for minting stablecoins by depositing reserve assets, with the issued amount determined by the current peg ratio. This mechanism allows for the creation of a stablecoin that can maintain stable value relative to a reference basket of assets or fiat currencies.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized stablecoin that maintains price stability through a transparent, on-chain reserve system. By pegging to a basket of assets rather than a single currency, we aim to reduce volatility and provide a more resilient stablecoin that is less susceptible to fluctuations in any single asset.

This stablecoin seeks to become a cornerstone for DeFi applications on the Aptos blockchain by providing a reliable medium of exchange and store of value that combines the benefits of blockchain technology with the stability of traditional financial assets.

## Future Scope
- **Multiple Asset Reserves**: Expand beyond AptosCoin to include other cryptocurrencies and tokenized real-world assets in the reserve basket
- **Dynamic Peg Ratio**: Implement oracles to automatically adjust the peg ratio based on market conditions
- **Governance System**: Add a governance mechanism allowing stakeholders to vote on parameter adjustments and reserve composition
- **Redemption Mechanisms**: Create efficient processes for redeeming stablecoins back to reserve assets
- **Liquidity Incentives**: Develop liquidity mining programs to incentivize deeper liquidity pools
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enable the stablecoin to operate across multiple blockchains
- **Algorithmic Stability**: Incorporate algorithmic methods to maintain peg in addition to the collateral-backed approach
- **Risk Management**: Implement advanced risk management tools to handle black swan events

## Key Features
- **Asset-Backed Stability**: Full collateralization through a transparent reserve system
- **Configurable Peg Ratio**: Adjustable ratio to represent a basket of assets
- **On-Chain Reserve Management**: All reserve assets are held and managed on-chain
- **Permissionless Minting**: Any user can mint stablecoins by providing collateral
- **Reserve Tracking**: Real-time tracking of total stablecoins in circulation and reserve levels
- **Timestamp-Based Updates**: Records of when peg ratios were last adjusted
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in checks to maintain reserve adequacy
